# asm-assign

This project demonstrates how to use inline assembly in C programs.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/VikashK24/asm-assign.git
cd asm-assign
make
./a.out
```

## Code Structure

- `inlineAsmExc.c` — The main program file that controls the overall execution (similar to a `main.c` file).
- `inlineAsmExc.h` — The header file that includes all required libraries and function declarations.
- `pureAsmExc.c` — Contains examples and exercises focused on basic inline assembly operations.
- `arrAsmExc.c` — Handles exercises related to arrays using inline assembly.
- `Makefile` — Automates the build process, including compilation, assembling, and linking to produce the final executable (`./a.out`).
